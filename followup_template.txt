Hey {name},

No pressure, just wanted to follow up personally.

I know what it’s like juggling product, growth, and website stuff all at once. That’s exactly why we built Solvia, so founders can stop losing time to things their site should handle on autopilot.

The 50% discount and free Solvia access are still open, but only for the next 2 founders.

Here’s my call link if you’re keen: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/nadra-6r3wo1j93/8bhg4oxs

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best,

Nadra
