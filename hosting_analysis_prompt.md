# Maily Project Analysis & Hosting Recommendations Prompt

## Project Overview
Analyze this Flask web application called "Maily" and recommend the best free hosting solutions for a small team.

## What Maily Does
Maily is a cold email automation tool that:
- **Integrates with Notion CRM** to fetch leads with "Not contacted" status
- **Analyzes lead websites** using OpenAI API for CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) opportunities  
- **Generates personalized email drafts** using AI and stores them back in Notion
- **Operates in draft-only mode** (doesn't send emails, just creates drafts)
- **Provides template management** for CRO audit prompts, summary prompts, and email templates

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask web application
- **Main files**: 
  - `app.py` (web interface, 240 lines)
  - `cold_emailer.py` (automation logic, 426 lines)
- **API endpoints**: REST API for template management
- **File storage**: JSON files for configuration and templates

### Dependencies (requirements.txt)
```
Flask==2.3.3
notion-client==2.0.0
openai==0.28.1
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
tqdm==4.66.1
retry==0.9.2
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
lxml==4.9.3
```

### Frontend
- **Single-page web interface** (templates/index.html, 481 lines)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** with modal dialogs
- **No complex frontend framework** required

### External APIs Required
- **Notion API** (free tier available)
- **OpenAI API** (paid, GPT-3.5-turbo)

### Environment Variables Needed
```
NOTION_API_KEY=xxx
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=xxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
```

### File System Requirements
- **Read/write access** for JSON config files
- **Static file serving** for templates
- **No database required** (uses Notion as database)

### Containerization
- **Dockerfile included** (367 bytes, 18 lines)
- **fly.toml configuration** for Fly.io deployment

## Current Hosting Setup
- Configured for **Fly.io** deployment
- **Procfile** for Heroku-style platforms
- **Dockerized** for container platforms

## Usage Pattern
- **Team size**: Small team (likely 2-10 users)
- **Usage frequency**: Periodic batch processing of leads
- **Resource needs**: Low to moderate (mainly API calls, minimal computation)
- **Uptime requirements**: Standard business hours (not 24/7 critical)

## Analysis Request
Please analyze this Flask application and recommend:

1. **Top 3 free hosting platforms** that would work best for this use case
2. **Specific deployment steps** for each recommended platform
3. **Pros and cons** of each option considering:
   - Free tier limitations
   - Ease of deployment
   - Team collaboration features
   - Environment variable management
   - File persistence
   - Container support
4. **Potential gotchas** or limitations to watch out for
5. **Upgrade paths** when the team grows or needs more resources

Consider that this is a business tool that needs to be reliable but isn't mission-critical, and the team values simplicity and cost-effectiveness over advanced features.
